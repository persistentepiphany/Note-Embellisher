OCR Service using EasyOCR with OpenCV preprocessing
====================================================

This service handles:
1. Image download from Dropbox
2. Image preprocessing using OpenCV for better OCR accuracy
3. Text extraction using EasyOCR (no system dependencies required)
4. Spelling and grammar correction using OpenAI API
5. Integration with ChatGPT service for note embellishment

Complete Flow:
-------------
User uploads image → main.py → OCR Service → ChatGPT Service → Database

Detailed Steps:
1. User uploads image via frontend
2. main.py: Stores image in Dropbox, creates DB record
3. main.py: Calls process_image_note_background() as background task
4. OCR Service (this file):
   a. Downloads image from Dropbox
   b. Preprocesses with OpenCV (grayscale, blur, threshold, morphology)
   c. Extracts text with EasyOCR
   d. Corrects spelling/OCR errors with OpenAI GPT-3.5
   e. Returns clean text
5. main.py: Receives clean text, updates note.text field
6. ChatGPT Service (chatgpt_service.py):
   a. Takes clean text
   b. Applies user settings (headers, bullets, expand, summarize)
   c. Embellishes with GPT-4 mini
   d. Returns beautifully formatted content
7. main.py: Updates note.processed_content field, marks as COMPLETED
8. Frontend: Displays embellished notes to user

Technology Stack:
-----------------
• EasyOCR: Text extraction (Python-based, no Tesseract dependency)
• OpenCV (cv2): Image preprocessing for better accuracy
• OpenAI GPT-3.5: Spelling/OCR error correction
• OpenAI GPT-4 mini: Full text embellishment (in chatgpt_service.py)
• Dropbox API: Image storage
• SQLite: Metadata and text storage

Key Features:
-------------
✅ No system dependencies (EasyOCR is pure Python)
✅ Advanced image preprocessing with OpenCV
✅ Two-stage AI processing (correction + embellishment)
✅ Lazy loading of EasyOCR (faster startup)
✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging
✅ Supports both images and PDFs
